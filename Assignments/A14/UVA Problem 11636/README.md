## UVA Problem 11636

### Overview

I won't lie, I'm pretty proud of myself for seeing the pattern in this one. I was able to get zero time, also. I realized that each of the values in the sequence was based on a power of
two. I would take the log base 2 of the value I read in, and if 2 to that power wasn't larger than the value I was trying to reach, I would just add one copy and paste. Pretty fun!
