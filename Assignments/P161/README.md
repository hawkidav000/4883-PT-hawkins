## Assignment 5
### UVA Problem 161: Traffic Lights

#### Overview:
In this problem, I tackled the issue of trying to solve when a series of traffic lights with different interval times would synchronize and all show green at the same time. 

#### Solution:
Overall, I'm not super proud of how I solved the problem, because I ended up using a brute force algorithm. I really struggled to find a way to creatively approach the problem using an algorithm, and so my solution ended up being O(n^2). However, I got an accepted solution on UVA Online Judge, so I'm happy.

#### Reflection:
I really enjoyed solving this problem, and doing problems like these reminds me why I really enjoy programming: tackling problems and figuring out creative, logical solutions. I'm really interested to continue learning how to optimize my code and achieve those 0.000 second solutions on UVA Online Judge.
