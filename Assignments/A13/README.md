### UVA Problem 1112: Mice and Maze

#### Overview
It's been a minute since I've worked this problem, because the solution I have posted here is the one I did in your Algorithm's class two years ago. However, I do remember that I
implemented my algorithm using Dijkstra's algorithm. I also remember this being one of the harder problems I've worked on, but I enjoyed it because I learned so much about graphs
from it.
